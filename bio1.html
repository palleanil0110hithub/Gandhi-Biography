    <p>Gandhi was a prolific writer. His signature style was simple, precise, clear and as devoid of artificialities.[276]
     One of Gandhi's earliest publications, Hind Swaraj, published in Gujarati in 1909, became "the intellectual blueprint" 
     for India's independence movement. The book was translated into English the next year, with a copyright legend that read 
     "No Rights Reserved".[277] For decades, Gandhi edited several newspapers including Harijan in Gujarati, in Hindi and in the 
     English language; Indian Opinion while in South Africa and, Young India, in English, and Navajivan, a Gujarati monthly, on his 
     return to India. Later, Navajivan was also published in Hindi. Gandhi also wrote letters almost every day to individuals and 
     newspapers.[278] Gandhi also wrote several books, including his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments with Truth 
     (Gujarātī "સત્યના પ્રયોગો અથવા આત્મકથા"),of which Gandhi bought the entire first edition to make sure it was reprinted.[279] 
     His other autobiographies included: Satyagraha in South Africa about his struggle there, Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule, 
     a political pamphlet, and a paraphrase in Gujarati of John Ruskin's Unto This Last which was an early critique of political 
     economy.[280] This last essay can be considered his programme on economics. Gandhi also wrote extensively on vegetarianism, 
     diet and health, religion, social reforms, etc. Gandhi usually wrote in Gujarati, though he also revised the Hindi and English
      translations of his books.[281] In 1934, Gandhi wrote Songs from Prison while prisoned in Yerawada jail in Maharashtra.[282] 
      Gandhi's complete works were published by the Indian government under the name The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi in the 1960s. 
      The writings comprise about 50,000 pages published in about 100 volumes. In 2000, a revised edition of the complete works sparked a 
      controversy, as it contained a large number of errors and omissions.[283] The Indian government later withdrew the revised edition.
      [284] See also: List of artistic depictions of Mahatma Gandhi, List of things named after Mahatma Gandhi, and List of roads named 
      after Mahatma Gandhi Gandhi is noted as the greatest figure of the successful Indian independence movement against the British rule. 
      He is also hailed as the greatest figure of modern India.[f] American historian Stanley Wolpert described Gandhi as "India's greatest 
      revolutionary nationalist leader" and the greatest Indian since the Buddha.[291] In 1999, Gandhi was named "Asian of the century" by 
      Asiaweek.[292] In a 2000 BBC poll, he was voted as the greatest man of the millennium.[293][294] The word Mahatma, while often 
      mistaken for Gandhi's given name in the West, is taken from the Sanskrit words maha (meaning Great) and atma (meaning Soul).[295][296] He was publicly bestowed with the honorific title "Mahatma" in July 1914 at farewell meeting in Town Hall, Durban.[297][298] Rabindranath Tagore is said to have accorded the title to Gandhi by 1915.[299][g] In his autobiography, Gandhi nevertheless explains that he never valued the title, and was often pained by it.</p>

    <p>Parents Gandhi's father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.
        [4][5] His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.[6] Although Karamchand only 
        had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary education, he proved a capable chief minister.[6] During his 
        tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third 
        marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai 
        (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh,[6] and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family.[7][8][9] Karamchand and Putlibai had 
        four children: a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); a second son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).
        [10][11] and a third son, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[12] who was born on 2 October 1869 in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), 
        a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the 
        British Raj.[13] In 1874, Gandhi's father, Karamchand, left Porbandar for the smaller state of Rajkot, where he became a 
        counsellor to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, the British regional political 
        agency was located there, which gave the state's diwan a measure of security.[14] In 1876, Karamchand became diwan of Rajkot and 
        was succeeded as diwan of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. Karamchand's family then rejoined him in Rajkot.[14] They moved to 
        their family home Kaba Gandhi No Delo in 1881.[15 Childhood Gandhi in 1876 at the age of 7.As a child, Gandhi was described 
        by his sister Raliat as "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' 
        ears."[16] The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his 
        childhood. In his autobiography, Gandhi states that they left an indelible impression on his mind. Gandhi writes: "It haunted me 
        and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number." Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as 
        supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.[17][18] The family's religious background was eclectic. Mohandas was born 
        into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family.[19][20] Gandhi's father, Karamchand, was Hindu and his mother Putlibai was from a Pranami 
        Vaishnava Hindu family.[21][22] Gandhi's father was of Modh Baniya caste in the varna of Vaishya.[23] His mother came from the 
        medieval Krishna bhakti-based Pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the Bhagavad Gita, the Bhagavata Purana, and a 
        collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the Vedas, the Quran and the Bible.
        [22][24] Gandhi was deeply influenced by his mother, an extremely pious lady who "would not think of taking her meals without 
        her daily prayers... she would take the hardest vows and keep them without flinching. To keep two or three consecutive fasts 
        was nothing to her."[25] At the age of nine, Gandhi entered the local school in Rajkot, near his home. There, he studied the 
        rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language and geography.[14] At the age of 11, Gandhi joined the High School in 
        Rajkot, Alfred High School.[26] He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue-tied student, with no 
        interest in games; Gandhi's only companions were books and school lessons.[27] Marriage In May 1883, the 13-year-old Gandhi 
        was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia (her first name was usually shortened to "Kasturba", and affectionately
        to "Ba") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time.[28] In the process, he lost a year at 
        school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies.[29] Gandhi's wedding was a joint event, where his brother 
        and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, Gandhi once said, "As we didn't know much about marriage, for 
        us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." As was the prevailing tradition, the adolescent 
        bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband.[30] Writing many years later, Gandhi described 
        with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride: "Even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall
        and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me." Gandhi later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when
        Kasturba would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.[31] Gandhi (right) 
        with his eldest brother Laxmidas in 1886[32 In late 1885, Gandhi's father, Karamchand, died.[33] Gandhi had left his father's 
        bedside to be with his wife mere minutes before his passing. Many decades later, Gandhi wrote "if animal passion had not blinded
        me, I should have been spared the torture of separation from my father during his last moments."[34] Later, Gandhi, then 
        16 years old, and his wife, age 17, had their first child, who survived only a few days. The two deaths anguished Gandhi.[33]
        The Gandhis had four more children, all sons: Harilal, born in 1888; Manilal, born in 1892; Ramdas, born in 1897; and Devdas, 
        born in 1900.[28] In November 1887, the 18-year-old Gandhi graduated from high school in Ahmedabad.[35] In January 1888, 
        he enrolled at Samaldas College in Bhavnagar State, then the sole degree-granting institution of higher education in the region. 
        However, Gandhi dropped out and returned to his family in Porbandar.[36] Outside school, Gandhi's education was enriched by 
        exposure to Gujarati literature, especially reformers like Narmad and Govardhanram Tripathi, whose works alerted the Gujaratis 
        to their own faults and weaknesses such as belief in religious dogmatism</p>

    <p>Student of law Commemorative plaque at 20 Baron's Court Road, Barons Court, Londo 
        Gandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay.[38] Mavji Dave Joshiji, a 
        Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London.[36][39] In July 
        1888, Gandhi's wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving child, Harilal.[40] Gandhi's mother was not comfortable about 
        Gandhi leaving his wife and family and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew, but 
        Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, 
        alcohol, and women. Gandhi's brother, Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.[36][41]

On 10 August 1888, Gandhi, aged 18, left Porbandar for Mumbai, then known as Bombay. A local newspaper covering the farewell function by his old high school in Rajkot noted that Gandhi was the first Bania from Kathiawar to proceed to England for his Barrister Examination.[37] As Mohandas Gandhi waited for a berth on a ship to London he found that he had attracted the ire of the Modh Banias of Bombay.[37] Upon arrival in Bombay, he stayed with the local Modh Bania community whose elders warned Gandhi that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways. Despite Gandhi informing them of his promise to his mother and her blessings, Gandhi was excommunicated from his caste. Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London, with his brother seeing him off.[38][40] Gandhi attended University College, London, where he took classes in English literature with Henry Morley in 1888–1889.[42]


Gandhi in London as a law student
Gandhi also enrolled at the Inns of Court School of Law in Inner Temple with the intention of becoming a barrister.[39] His childhood shyness and self-withdrawal had continued through his teens. Gandhi retained these traits when he arrived in London, but joined a public speaking practice group and overcame his shyness sufficiently to practise law.[43]

Gandhi demonstrated a keen interest in the welfare of London's impoverished dockland communities. In 1889, a bitter trade dispute broke out in London, with dockers striking for better pay and conditions, and seamen, shipbuilders, factory girls and other joining the strike in solidarity. The strikers were successful, in part due to the mediation of Cardinal Manning, leading Gandhi and an Indian friend to make a point of visiting the cardinal and thanking him for his work.[44]

Vegetarianism and committee work

Gandhi with the Vegetarian Society on the Isle of Wight, 1890
His vow to his mother influenced Gandhi's time in London. Gandhi tried to adopt "English" customs, including taking dancing lessons.[45] However, he didn't appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by Henry Salt's writing, Gandhi joined the London Vegetarian Society (LVS) and was elected to its executive committee under the aegis of its president and benefactor Arnold Hills.[46] An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a Bayswater chapter.[47] Some of the vegetarians Gandhi met were members of the Theosophical Society, which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of Buddhist and Hindu literature. They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the Bhagavad Gita both in translation as well as in the original.[46]

Gandhi had a friendly and productive relationship with Hills, but the two men took a different view on the continued LVS membership of fellow committee member Thomas Allinson. Their disagreement is the first known example of Gandhi challenging authority, despite his shyness and temperamental disinclination towards confrontation.[citation needed]

Allinson had been promoting newly available birth control methods, but Hills disapproved of these, believing they undermined public morality. He believed vegetarianism to be a moral movement and that Allinson should therefore no longer remain a member of the LVS. Gandhi shared Hills' views on the dangers of birth control, but defended Allinson's right to differ.[48] It would have been hard for Gandhi to challenge Hills; Hills was 12 years his senior and unlike Gandhi, highly eloquent. Hills bankrolled the LVS and was a captain of industry with his Thames Ironworks company employing more than 6,000 people in the East End of London. Hills was also a highly accomplished sportsman who later founded the football club West Ham United. In his 1927 An Autobiography, Vol. I, Gandhi wrote:

The question deeply interested me...I had a high regard for Mr. Hills and his generosity. But I thought it was quite improper to exclude a man from a vegetarian society simply because he refused to regard puritan morals as one of the objects of the society[48]

A motion to remove Allinson was raised, and was debated and voted on by the committee. Gandhi's shyness was an obstacle to his defence of Allinson at the committee meeting. Gandhi wrote his views down on paper, but shyness prevented Gandhi from reading out his arguments, so Hills, the President, asked another committee member to read them out for him. Although some other members of the committee agreed with Gandhi, the vote was lost and Allinson was excluded. There were no hard feelings, with Hills proposing the toast at the LVS farewell dinner in honour of Gandhi's return to India.[49]</p>
    <h1 id="Struggle for indian independens">Struggle for indian independens</h1>
    <p>At the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to Gandhi by C. F. Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.

Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.[83]

Gandhi took leadership of the Congress in 1920 and began escalating demands until on 26 January 1930 the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India. The British did not recognise the declaration, but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation. Tensions escalated until Gandhi demanded immediate independence in 1942, and the British responded by imprisoning him and tens of thousands of Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Muslim League did co-operate with Britain and moved, against Gandhi's strong opposition, to demands for a totally separate Muslim state of Pakistan. In August 1947, the British partitioned the land with India and Pakistan each achieving independence on terms that Gandhi disapproved.[84]

Role in World War I
See also: The role of India in World War I
In April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi.[85] Gandhi agreed to support the war effort.[38][86] In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled "Appeal for Enlistment", Gandhi wrote: "To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them... If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army."[87] However, Gandhi stipulated in a letter to the Viceroy's private secretary that he "personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe."[88]

Gandhi's support for the war campaign brought into question his consistency on nonviolence. Gandhi's private secretary noted that "The question of the consistency between his creed of 'Ahimsa' (nonviolence) and his recruiting campaign was raised not only then but has been discussed ever since."[86] According to political and educational scientist Christian Bartolf, Gandhi's support for the war stemmed from his belief that true ahimsa could not exist simultaneously with cowardice. Therefore, Gandhi felt that Indians needed to be willing and capable of using arms before they voluntarily chose non-violence.[89]

In July 1918, Gandhi said that he could not persuade even one individual to enlist for the world war. "So far I have not a single recruit to my credit apart," Gandhi wrote. He added: "They object because they fear to die."[90]

Champaran agitations
Main article: Champaran Satyagraha

Gandhi in 1918, at the time of the Kheda and Champaran Satyagrahas
Gandhi's first major achievement came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against largely Anglo-Indian plantation owners who were backed by the local administration. The peasants were forced to grow indigo (Indigofera sp.), a cash crop for Indigo dye whose demand had been declining over two decades and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.[91]

Kheda agitations
Main article: Kheda Satyagraha
In 1918, Kheda was hit by floods and famine and the peasantry was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad,[92] organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel.[93] Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win public support for the agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused, but by the end of May 1918, the government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers in negotiations with the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.[94]

Khilafat Movement
Main article: Khilafat Movement

Gandhi (wearing a Gandhi cap) with Rabindranath Tagore and Sharda Mehta, 1920
In 1919, following World War I, Gandhi (aged 49) sought political co-operation from Muslims in his fight against British imperialism by supporting the Ottoman Empire that had been defeated in the World War. Before this initiative of Gandhi, communal disputes and religious riots between Hindus and Muslims were common in British India, such as the riots of 1917–18. Gandhi had already vocally supported the British crown in the first world war.[95] This decision of Gandhi was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I.[96] The British government had offered, instead of self-government, minor reforms instead, disappointing Gandhi.[97] He announced his satyagraha (civil disobedience) intentions. The British colonial officials made their counter move by passing the Rowlatt Act, to block Gandhi's movement. The Act allowed the British government to treat civil disobedience participants as criminals and gave it the legal basis to arrest anyone for "preventive indefinite detention, incarceration without judicial review or any need for a trial."[98]

Gandhi felt that Hindu-Muslim co-operation was necessary for political progress against the British. He leveraged the Khilafat Movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, their leaders such as the sultans of princely states in India and the Ali brothers (Shaukat Ali and Mohammad Ali Jauhar) championed the Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (ummah). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I.[99][100][101] Gandhi's support to the Khilafat Movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the Sunni Islamic Caliph in Turkey.[d]

The increasing Muslim support for Gandhi, after he championed the Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt satyagraha demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi's stature as the political leader to the British.[105][106] His support for the Khilafat Movement also helped Gandhi sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced his opposition to the satyagraha non-co-operation movement approach of Gandhi. Jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan. Though they agreed in general terms on Indian independence, they disagreed on the means of achieving this. Jinnah was mainly interested in dealing with the British via constitutional negotiation, rather than attempting to agitate the masses.[107][108][109]

In 1922, the Khilafat Movement gradually collapsed following the end of the non-cooperation movement with the arrest of Gandhi.[110] A number of Muslim leaders and delegates abandoned Gandhi and Congress.[111] Hindu-Muslim communal conflicts reignited, and deadly religious riots re-appeared in numerous cities, with 91 in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh alone.[112][113]

Non-co-operation
Main article: Non-co-operation movement
With his book Hind Swaraj (1909) Gandhi, aged 40, declared that British rule was established in India with the co-operation of Indians and had survived only because of this co-operation. If Indians refused to co-operate, British rule would collapse and swaraj (Indian independence) would come.[5][114]


Gandhi with Annie Besant en route to a meeting in Madras in September 1921. Earlier, in Madurai, on 21 September 1921, Gandhi had adopted the loin-cloth for the first time as a symbol of his identification with India's poor.
In February 1919, Gandhi cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable communication that if the British were to pass the Rowlatt Act, he would appeal to Indians to start civil disobedience.[115] The British government ignored him and passed the law, stating it would not yield to threats. The satyagraha civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in satyagraha in Delhi.[115]

People rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, Gandhi asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but to express their frustration with peace, to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing they owned. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side used violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. Government warned him not to enter Delhi, but Gandhi defied the order and was arrested on 9 April.[115]

On 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and British Indian Army officer Reginald Dyer surrounded them and ordered troops under his command to fire on them. The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent but was supported by some Britons and parts of the British media as a necessary response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using 'love' to deal with the 'hate' of the British government.[115] Gandhi demanded that the Indian people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting.[116]</p>

    Gandhi is noted as the greatest figure of the successful Indian independence movement against the British rule. He is also hailed as the greatest figure of modern India.[f] American historian Stanley Wolpert described Gandhi as "India's greatest revolutionary nationalist leader" and the greatest Indian since the Buddha.[291] In 1999, Gandhi was named "Asian of the century" by Asiaweek.[292] In a 2000 BBC poll, he was voted as the greatest man of the millennium.[293][294]

    The word Mahatma, while often mistaken for Gandhi's given name in the West, is taken from the Sanskrit words maha (meaning Great) and atma (meaning Soul).[295][296] He was publicly bestowed with the honorific title "Mahatma" in July 1914 at farewell meeting in Town Hall, Durban.[297][298] Rabindranath Tagore is said to have accorded the title to Gandhi by 1915.[299][g] In his autobiography, Gandhi nevertheless explains that he never valued the title, and was often pained by it.[302][303][304]


    In 1961 the U.S. government issued two commemorative stamps in honour of Mahatma Gandhi.[305]
    Innumerable streets, roads, and localities in India are named after Gandhi. These include M.G.Road (the main street of a number of Indian cities including Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Lucknow, Kanpur, Gangtok and Indore), Gandhi Market (near Sion, Mumbai) and Gandhinagar (the capital of the state of Gujarat, Gandhi's birthplace).[306]

    As of 2008, over 150 countries have released stamps on Gandhi.[307] In October 2019, about 87 countries including Turkey, the United States, Russia, Iran, Uzbekistan, and Palestine released commemorative Gandhi stamps on the 150th anniversary of his birth.[308][309][310][311]

    Florian asteroid 120461 Gandhi was named in his honour in September 2020.[314] In October 2022, a statue of Gandhi was installed in
     Astana on the embankment of the rowing canal, opposite the cult monument to the defenders of Kazakhstan.[315] On 15 December 2022, 
     the United Nations headquarters in New York unveiled the statue of Gandhi. UN Secretary-General António Guterrecalled Gandhi an 
     "uncompromising advocate for peaceful co-existence."[316] On 11 April 2025, the Anglo-Boer War Museum in Bloemfontein, South Africa 
     launched a documentary called Caught in the Crossfire: Indian Involvement in the South African War, and unveiled a bust of Gandhi. 
     This was part of the museum's initiatives to acknowledge the role of Indian individuals — soldiers, stretcher-bearers and civilians — 
     who were caught in the conflict between the British and the Boers during the Second Boer War.[317] Followers and international 
     influence Gandhi influenced important leaders and political movements.[261] Leaders of the civil rights movement in the United States, 
     including Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, and James Bevel, drew from the writings of Gandhi in the development of their own 
     theories about nonviolence.[318][319][320] King said, "Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the tactics."[321] King sometimes 
     referred to Gandhi as "the little brown saint."[322] Anti-apartheid activist and former President of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, was 
     inspired by Gandhi.[323] Others include Steve Biko, Václav Havel,[324] and Aung San Suu Kyi.[325] Bust of Gandhi at York University, 
     Toronto, CanadaStatue of Gandhi in Madrid, SpainGandhi at Praça Túlio Fontoura, São Paulo, BrazilIn his early years, the former 
     President of South Africa Nelson Mandela was a follower of the nonviolent resistance philosophy of Gandhi.[323] Bhana and Vahed 
     commented on these events as "Gandhi inspired succeeding generations of South African activists seeking to end White rule. This 
     legacy connects him to Nelson Mandela...in a sense, Mandela completed what Gandhi started."[326Gandhi's life and teachings inspired 
     many who specifically referred to Gandhi as their mentor or who dedicated their lives to spreading his ideas. In Europe, Romain 
     Rolland was the first to discuss Gandhi in his 1924 book Mahatma Gandhi, and Brazilian anarchist and feminist Maria Lacerda de
      Moura wrote about Gandhi in her work on pacifism. In 1931, physicist Albert Einstein exchanged letters with Gandhi and called him "a role model for the generations to come" in
      a letter writing about him.[327] Einstein said of Gandhi:Mahatma Gandhi's life achievement stands unique in political history. He has 
      invented a completely new and humane means for the liberation war of an oppressed country, and practised it with greatest energy and 
      devotion. The moral influence he had on the consciously thinking human being of the entire civilised world will probably be much more 
      lasting than it seems in our time with its overestimation of brutal violent forces. Because lasting will only be the work of such 
      statesmen who wake up and strengthen the moral power of their people through their example and educational works. We may all be happy 
      and grateful that destiny gifted us with such an enlightened contemporary, a role model for the generations to come. Generations to 
      come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood.Farah Omar, a political activist from Somaliland, 
      visited India in 1930, where he met Gandhi and was influenced by Gandhi's non-violent philosophy, which he adopted in his campaign in 
      British Somaliland.[328] Lanza del Vasto went to India in 1936 intending to live with Gandhi; he later returned to Europe to spread 
      Gandhi's philosophy and founded the Community of the Ark in 1948 (modelled after Gandhi's ashrams). Madeleine Slade 
      (known as "Mirabehn") was the daughter of a British admiral who spent much of her adult life in India as a devotee of Gandhi.[329][330] In addition,
    the British musician John Lennon referred to Gandhi when discussing his views on nonviolence.[331] In 2007, former US Vice-President 
    and environmentalist Al Gore drew upon Gandhi's idea of satyagraha in a speech on climate change.[332] 44th President of the United 
    States Barack Obama said in September 2009 that his biggest inspiration came from Gandhi. His reply was in response to the question: 
    "Who was the one person, dead or live, that you would choose to dine with?" Obama added, "He's somebody I find a lot of inspiration in.
    He inspired Dr. King with his message of nonviolence. He ended up doing so much and changed the world just by the power of his ethics.
    "[333] Time magazine named The 14th Dalai Lama, Lech Wałęsa, Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, Aung San Suu Kyi, Benigno Aquino Jr.
    , Desmond Tutu, and Nelson Mandela as Children of Gandhi and his spiritual heirs to nonviolence.[334] The Mahatma Gandhi District in 
    Houston, Texas, United States, an ethnic Indian enclave, is officially named after Gandhi.[335] Gandhi's ideas had a significant 
    influence on 20th-century philosophy. It began with his engagement with Romain Rolland and Martin Buber. Jean-Luc Nancy said that 
    the French philosopher Maurice Blanchot engaged critically with Gandhi from the point of view of "European spirituality."[336] Since
     then philosophers including Hannah Arendt, Etienne Balibar and Slavoj Žižek found that Gandhi was a necessary reference to discuss 
     morality in politics. American political scientist Gene Sharp wrote an analytical text, Gandhi as a political strategist, on the
     
     significance of Gandhi's ideas, for creating nonviolent social change. Recently, in the light of climate change, Gandhi's views on technology are gaining importance in the fields of environmental philosophy and philosophy of technology.[336]</p>

    <p>At 5:17 p.m. on 30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his grandnieces in the garden of Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), on his
    way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, fired three bullets into Gandhi's chest from a pistol at 
    close range.[192][193] According to some accounts, Gandhi died instantly.[194][195] In other accounts, such as one prepared by an 
    eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried into the Birla House, into a bedroom.
    There, he died about 30 minutes later as one of Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.[196][197][198][199][184Prime 
    Minister Jawaharlal Nehru addressed his countrymen over the All-India Radio saying:[200]Friends and comrades, the light has gone out of 
    our lives, and there is darkness everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we 
    called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have 
    seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me,
    but for millions and millions in this country.[201]Memorial at the location of Gandhi's assassination in 1948. His stylised footsteps 
    lead to the memorial.Godse, a Hindu nationalist,[202][193][203] with links to the Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh,
    [204][205][206][207][184] made no attempt to escape; several other conspirators were soon arrested as well. The accused were Nathuram 
    Vinayak Godse, Narayan Apte, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Shankar Kistayya, Dattatraya Parchure, Vishnu Karkare, Madanlal Pahwa, and Gopal 
    Godse.[184][207][208][209][210][211] The trial began on 27 May 1948 and ran for eight months before Justice Atma Charan passed his final 
    order on 10 February 1949. The prosecution called 149 witnesses, the defence none.[212] The court found all of the defendants except one
    guilty as charged. Eight men were convicted for the murder conspiracy, and others were convicted for violation of the Explosive 
    Substances Act. Savarkar was acquitted and set free. Nathuram Godse and Narayan Apte were sentenced to death by hanging[213] while
    the remaining six (including Godse's brother, Gopal) were sentenced to life imprisonment.[214] Funeral and memorials Gandhi's funeral
    was marked by millions of Indians.[215]Gandhi's death was mourned nationwide.[197][198][199][184] Over a million people joined the
    five-mile-long funeral procession that took over five hours to reach Raj Ghat from Birla house, where Gandhi was assassinated, and 
    another million watched the procession pass by.[215] His body was transported on a weapons carrier, whose chassis was dismantled 
    overnight to allow a high-floor to be installed so that people could catch a glimpse of Gandhi's body. The engine of the vehicle was
    not used; instead, four drag-ropes held by 50 people each pulled the vehicle.[216] All Indian-owned establishments in London remained 
    closed in mourning as thousands of people from all faiths and denominations and Indians from all over Britain converged at India 
    House in London.[217] Cremation of Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat, 31 January 1948. It was attended by Jawaharlal Nehru, Louis and 
    Edwina Mountbatten, Maulana Azad, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, Sarojini Naidu and other national leaders. His son Devdas Gandhi lit the 
    pyre.[218]Gandhi was cremated in accordance with Hindu tradition. His ashes were poured into urns which were sent across India for
    memorial services.[219] Most of the ashes were immersed at the Sangam at Allahabad on 12 February 1948, but some were secretly taken
    away. In 1997, Tushar Gandhi immersed the contents of one urn, found in a bank vault and reclaimed through the courts, at the Sangam 
    at Allahabad.[220][221] Some of Gandhi's ashes were scattered at the source of the Nile River near Jinja, Uganda, and a memorial 
    plaque marks the event. On 30 January 2008, the contents of another urn were immersed at Girgaum Chowpatty. Another urn is at the
     palace of the Aga Khan in Pune (where Gandhi was held as a political prisoner from 1942 to 1944[222][223]) and another in the 
     Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Los Angeles.[220][224][225] The Birla House site where Gandhi was assassinated is now 
     a memorial called Gandhi Smriti. The place near Yamuna River where he was cremated is the Rāj Ghāt memorial in New Delhi.[226] A 
     black marble platform, it bears the epigraph "Hē Rāma" (Devanagari: हे ! राम or, Hey Raam). These are said to be Gandhi's last words
      after he was shot.[227] According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in his final year of life was an ascetic, and his sickly skeletal figure was caricatured in Western media.[273] In February 1947, he asked his confidants such as Birla and Ramakrishna if it was wrong for him to experiment his brahmacharya oath.[clarification needed][269] Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi said that if he would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Some of his staff resigned, including two of his newspaper's editors who had refused to print some of Gandhi's sermons dealing with his experiments.[271] Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example, criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments.[272] Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on 
      brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.[274]Gandhi also supported alcohol abstinence, advocating Prohibition as the only effective way to deal with alcohol usage.[275]</p>
